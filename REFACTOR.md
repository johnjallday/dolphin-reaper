# Dolphin-Reaper Refactoring

## Overview

The `dolphin-reaper` project has been refactored to improve maintainability, testability, and code organization. The previously monolithic `main.go` file (451 lines) has been broken down into organized packages.

## New Package Structure

```
dolphin-reaper/
├── main.go                  # Entry point (120 lines, down from 451)
├── pkg/
│   ├── types/              # Common data structures
│   │   └── types.go        # Settings, AgentsConfig, ScriptItem, ScriptList
│   ├── platform/           # Platform-specific operations
│   │   └── platform.go     # OS detection, default paths, REAPER launching
│   ├── scripts/            # Script management
│   │   └── scripts.go      # Script listing, execution, formatting
│   └── settings/           # Configuration management
│       └── settings.go     # Settings loading, saving, agent context
└── go.mod
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **types**: Common data structures shared across packages
- **platform**: OS-specific functionality isolated
- **scripts**: Script management logic separated
- **settings**: Configuration handling centralized

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each package has a single responsibility
- Functions are logically grouped by functionality
- Easier to locate and modify specific features
- Reduced complexity in main.go (from 451 to 120 lines)

### 3. **Better Testability**
- Individual packages can be unit tested independently
- Mock implementations easier to create
- Dependencies clearly defined through interfaces

### 4. **Enhanced Readability**
- Clear package names indicate functionality
- Smaller files are easier to understand
- Related functions grouped together

## Package Details

### `pkg/types`
Contains all shared data structures:
- `Settings`: Plugin configuration
- `AgentsConfig`: Agent context information
- `ScriptItem`: Individual script representation
- `ScriptList`: Structured script list for UI

### `pkg/platform`
Handles OS-specific operations:
- `UserHome()`: Get user home directory
- `DefaultScriptsDir()`: Platform-specific REAPER script paths
- `IsReaperRunning()`: Check if REAPER is running
- `LaunchScript()`: Launch scripts using OS-specific methods

### `pkg/scripts`
Manages script operations:
- `ListLuaScripts()`: Discover .lua files in directory
- `Manager`: Script management with listing and execution
- `ToTitleCase()`: Text formatting utilities

### `pkg/settings`
Handles configuration:
- `Manager`: Settings management with persistence
- Agent-specific settings loading
- Default settings generation
- JSON serialization/deserialization

## Migration Notes

### What Changed
- **Imports**: Updated to use `github.com/johnjallday/dolphin-reaper-plugin/pkg/*`
- **Global Variables**: Moved to appropriate packages
- **Function Organization**: Grouped by responsibility
- **Dependencies**: Clearly defined package boundaries

### What Stayed the Same
- **Public API**: All pluginapi.Tool interface methods unchanged
- **Functionality**: Identical behavior from user perspective
- **Build Process**: Same build commands and output
- **Configuration**: Same settings structure and file locations

## Building

The build process remains unchanged:

```bash
# Plugin build
go build -buildmode=plugin -o reascript_launcher.so main.go

# Development
go mod tidy  # Update dependencies
```

## Future Enhancements

The new structure enables:
- **Unit Tests**: Each package can be tested independently
- **Mocking**: Easy to create mock implementations for testing
- **Feature Extensions**: New functionality can be added to appropriate packages
- **Code Reuse**: Packages can be imported by other projects
- **Documentation**: Each package can have focused documentation

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility:
- Same plugin interface and exported symbols
- Identical functionality and behavior
- Same configuration files and settings
- No changes required for users or host applications
